## How to use

- Clone SpExtor to your local machine:
- ```sh 
    git clone git@github.com:halolimat/SpExtor.git
    ```
- Download and install IntelliJ IDEA from [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
- Open IntelliJ, click on open, navigate to where you cloned SpExtor, select the folder SpExtor, hit Open.
- In the src -> test -> java -> Test_SpExtor.java, modify the parameters as you desire and then run the code.
- You can serialize the final CRF model from Active Learning.
- The sigma values over the different batches can be found under SpExtor/out.
